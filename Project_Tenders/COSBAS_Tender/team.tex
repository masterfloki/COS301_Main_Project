\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
This project seemed like it would be a rather interesting project to do as well as the fact that it would be great exposure to a whole new side of IT that I have not yet had the privilege of delving into. I believe that by doing this project I will get valuable exposure that can later help in other projects that I might attempt. This project also seems like it would be a good challenge since I am more comfortable with smaller projects and systems and by doing a larger project such as this it will help me broaden my range of capabilities. Lastly due to the size of the project and the strict time line the pressure will be greatly increased helping me to work at my best without losing interest with the project.
