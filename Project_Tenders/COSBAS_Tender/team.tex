\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
This project seemed like it would be a rather interesting project to do as well as the fact that it would be great exposure to a whole new side of IT that I have not yet had the privilege of delving into. I believe that by doing this project I will get valuable exposure that can later help in other projects that I might attempt. This project also seems like it would be a good challenge since I am more comfortable with smaller projects and systems and by doing a larger project such as this it will help me broaden my range of capabilities. Lastly due to the size of the project and the strict time line the pressure will be greatly increased helping me to work at my best without losing interest with the project.

\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
The field of computer security and the use of biometric systems is extremely interesting to me. I might not have the relevant experience but I know that my persistence and perfectionism will suffice in producing a well planned and valuable product. I am always open to new and exciting challenges and will enjoy this project as such. This project will also give me extremely valuable experience and help me grow as a programmer in software security.

\subsection{Vivian Laura-Lee Venter}
\input{../VivianStandard}
\subsubsection{Past Experience} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{I have written Java programs and small systems as assignments for my modules at the University of Pretoria}
	\item{I have written C++ programs and small systems as assignments for my modules at the University of Pretoria}
	\item{I have written several types of server programs (e.g HTTP) as assignments for my modules at the University of Pretoria}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
This project is certainly something I have never done before. Being only a novice in Biometrics, I am extremely interested in the biometrics aspect of this project. I wanted to do a project where I could learn new, interesting and relevant things. Although this project will be a huge challenge I am willing to dedicate myself and work hard to succeed.

\subsection{Tienie Pritchard}
\input{../TienieStandard}
\subsubsection{Past Experience} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Two years of experience in writing and implementing Java programs, specifically related to creating data structures and concurrency to achieve various tasks}
	\item{Two years of experience in writing and implementing C++ programs, including implementation of various design patterns as well as general program design}
	\item{As part of my Networks module, I have experience in implementing protocols such as HTTP, SMTP and POP3}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
I believe the opportunity to learn more about how software controls and interacts with external hardware would be amazing. Also, the ability to gain experience with working with biometrics would be invaluable, since I have little to no experience working with it (although I find it very interesting).
