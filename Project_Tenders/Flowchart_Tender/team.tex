\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
This project seemed like it would be a rather interesting project to do as well as the fact that it would be great exposure to a whole new side of IT that I have not yet had the privilege of delving into. I believe that by doing this project I will get valuable exposure that can later help in other projects that I might attempt. This project also seems like it would be a good challenge since I am more comfortable with smaller projects and systems and by doing a larger project such as this it will help me broaden my range of capabilities. Lastly due to the size of the project and the strict time line the pressure will be greatly increased helping me to work at my best without losing interest with the project.

\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
The reason I started with software development is to make life a bit easier for everyone, and this project fits right into that goal. Creating a software product to teach others an important part of computer science logic more easily and austhetically pleasing will help thousands of students.

\subsection{Renette Ros}

\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
I want to do this project because creating an application like this will be very interesting because it is completely different from the things we have done up to now. I also believe it is important to have flowcharting software that forces students to create correctly structured flowcharts but is still easy to use since I got frustrated a lot with the flowcharting software we used in COS151.

\input{../SzymonStandard}
\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project} 
I want to do this project because it poses many interesting challenges and has a cool factor to it. I have little to no experience in most aspects of this project but this is also the reason why I want to do this project as it will allow me to gain experience and learn new things.

\subsection{Vivian Laura-Lee Venter}
\input{../VivianStandard}
\subsubsection{Past Experience} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{I have written Java programs and small systems as assignments for my modules at the University of Pretoria}
	\item{I have experience in Design Patterns from my COS121 module. I also was a teaching assistant for the design patterns module which gave me even more experience and knowledge in design patterns}
	\item{I have written C++ programs and small systems as assignments for my modules at the University of Pretoria}
	\item{I have written several types of server programs (e.g HTTP) as assignments for my modules at the University of Pretoria}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
The reason I want to do this project is the mere fact that I was initially scared of this one, well mostly the execution environment. I am a person that loves to learn new things or to challenge myself and this is why I want to do this project.
