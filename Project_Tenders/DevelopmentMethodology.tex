%\subsection{Development Methodology}
Our team will be using the \textbf{agile software development methodology}. The agile manifesto states that we find value in the following four points:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
	\item Working software over comprehensive documentation.
	\item Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
	\item Responding to change over following a plan.
\end{itemize}
Although we find value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left even more.\\
In agile development, the testing phase, which is usually separate from development in other methodologies such as Waterfall, runs concurrently with development. This increases the \emph{quality} of the product and means that at any point in the development phase there will be a \emph{working model} available with new features and functionality being added only after they pass vigorous testing.\\
The agile methodology has a proven low project schedule risk and the ability to respond to change, from the client or development team, quickly.
