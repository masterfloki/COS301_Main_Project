% project execution for IM -> I suggest we discuss this first before adding any sections etc.

\subsection{Development Methodology}
\input{../DevelopmentMethodology.tex}

\subsection{Keeping the Client Informed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wiki
    \item Weekly/Bi-Weekly Meeting
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Initial Ideas on Solving Some Technical Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Social Network Messengers to be integrated:
    \item Finding existing APIs to communicate with each IM service 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For example, via Facebook SDK
            \item SMSing can easily be done on Android (using ContentResolver)
            \item ContentResolver can also load contacts
        \end{itemize}
    \item Finding ways of associating contacts with each of the IM applications
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Link based on name/first name
            \item Cell Phone Number/E-mail
            \item Storage of these associations and each contact from each IM application
            \item We'll assume that each of the specified messenger's contacts are already stored on the user's mobile device, which we'll access via Android's SDK
        \end{itemize}
    \item Plugability
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use of Adapter design pattern
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Technologies We Will Use}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Android Operating System
        \item Java
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{What the Client Will Receive}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A fully integrated (but basic) Instant Messaging Aggregator
        \item High quality interface design
        \item High quality UX design
        \item Good HCI 
        \item Good performance from the application
        \item This application will be pluggable, allowing for easy integration of other IM applications

    \end{itemize}
