\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
This project seemed like it would be a rather interesting project to do as well as the fact that it would be great exposure to a whole new side of IT that I have not yet had the privilege of delving into. I believe that by doing this project I will get valuable exposure that can later help in other projects that I might attempt. This project also seems like it would be a good challenge since I am more comfortable with smaller projects and systems and by doing a larger project such as this it will help me broaden my range of capabilities. Lastly due to the size of the project and the strict time line the pressure will be greatly increased helping me to work at my best without losing interest with the project.

\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
The world is buzzing with social networking and new services are added frequently. The reason I started with software development is to make life a bit easier for everyone, and this project fits right into that goal. Having a centralized point of communicating with people via different services will help individuals to ease communication and revolutionise the way marketing companies do their work.

\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project} 
I want to do this project because I think integrating the different instant messaging services, using their api's and keeping the system pluggable) will be an interesting challenge.  I am also interested in this project because it is a useful real-world application that I can see myself using. I believe this project will give me valuable experience in using api's from web-based services and also in developing for android. I have a lot of knowledge about HCI and I believe this will be a good project to apply it.

\subsection{Tienie Pritchard}
\input{../TienieStandard}
\subsubsection{Past Experience} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Two years of experience in writing and implementing Java programs, specifically related to creating data structures and concurrency to achieve various tasks}
	\item{Two years of experience in writing and implementing C++ programs, including implementation of various design patterns as well as general program design}
	\item{As part of my Networks module, I have experience in implementing protocols such as HTTP, SMTP and POP3}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Why I want to do this project}
The instant messaging aggregator fits in perfectly with modern trends in Multimedia. Since my degree is in Multimedia, this project would definitely help me get more hands on experience with working with these systems in practice. Additionally, I feel that Instant Messaging is a very popular as a system which has everyday use, and thus an aggregator would be very relevant. Furthermore, this project presents an ideal opportunity to work with different APIs (specifically relating the Android Operating System).
